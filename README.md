# job-market
This repo contains the instructions for the job market data collection task and is the seed for the group assignment.

If you are reading this and you are not in a team (but feel you should be) please see your lecturer.

## Instructions
1. If you are the team creator, name it ``[STREAM][number], meaning if you are in stream A and you are told to start team 1, name it A1.
2. If you are assigned a team, join it.
3. Access the team repo.
4. Crunch the data you have all collected.
5. Replace the contents of this README with the results. (That way your results will show up nicely displayed at the bottom of your team repo.)
